#  IMPORTANT: Read all the comments and all of the info/instructions below before making this your own hyprland config, it is important to understand that you should know the basics of Hyprland and more importantly LINUX. I highly do not recommend switching/using ARCH LINUX of all distros of linux if you do not know the basics first.

#  NOTE: Note that you are gonna need the "folke/todo-comments.nvim" to read all the COMMENTS in their FULL style

#  NOTE: File path is ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf

#  NOTE: Aliasing all of the main stuff I use to their respective terms.

#  TODO: Document this entire config in a seperate file, not like this, perheps do it inside of ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf.md?
