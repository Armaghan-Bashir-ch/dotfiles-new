> [!Caution]
> These Dotfiles, are just my files that I use for my daily workflow on Arch Linux Hyprland, they are absolutely **not meant to be a project**

Arch Linux _and_ hyprland is required as well as many other applications that will be installed when running:  
`./install.sh`
Make sure your device has efficent storage and Ram to handle all of this, becuase it is a lot of stuff.

This _can_ work on other [Linux-distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) with Hyprland as GUI, but I have not tested it, and I will not, so do that on your own risk.

##### Commands

```
[ -d ~/.config ] \
mv ~/.config ~/.config.backup
```

> [!Note]
> This will first check if `~/.config` exists, and if it does it will backup all of the existing files and dirs inside of it to `~/.config.backup`  
> Make sure to run this command before cloning.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Armaghan-Bashir-ch/dotfiles ~/.config
```

This will clone the entire repo to `~/.config`

> [!Caution]
> Note that **this will override everything in your current `~/.config` folder, every single file**.
> However, this command makes sure to backup existing files and dirs (if they exist) inside `~/.config/backup`.

> [!Tip]
> Changes may not apply, if you have not restarted or rebooted your device, so make sure to do that after the installation is completed.
